# Development and experimentation of Reinforcement Learning algorithms for controlling the flight of a space rocket<br />

<br /><br />The project has been built up using Unity as a rendering / physic engine for the custom gravity simulation in C#. While for for controlling the flight of a space rocket i used reiforment learning,
particulary the Proximal policy optimization [PPO Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347).

Repository containing the two parts of the undergraduate thesis project in computer engineering by Federico Galli.

You can select the two different projects by browsing through the tags. Below, you can view the videos referenced in the written work.<br /><br /><br />

# First Part: Flat Celestial Body; Objective: Takeoff, Hovering, and Landing

<br />Explanatory video of the ascent phase:<br />

# Second Part: Spherical Celestial Body; Objective: Reaching Equatorial Orbit of the Celestial Body<br />

<br />Explanatory video of the gravitational attraction between a blue body (mass 13000) and a red body (mass 10), both with no initial velocity.<br />

<br /><br />Explanatory video of the gravitational attraction between a blue body (mass 13000) and a red body (mass 10). The latter has a velocity along the X-axis that allows it to orbit around the massive body.<br />

<br /><br />Explanatory video of the gravitational attraction between two bodies with the same mass, both with velocities along the X-axis that allow them to orbit a point outside of the bodies themselves.<br />

<br /><br />Explanatory video of the behavior of an agent trained to orbit the starting celestial body with a circular equatorial orbit. To appreciate the rocket's orbiting, the footage has been sped up by a factor of 10 during the orbiting phase compared to normal speed.<br />
